SOCKS
Socket Secure (SOCKS) is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 additionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.

SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport layer). SOCKS server accepts incoming client connection on TCP port 1080.

Step01:	Adding proxys in proxy chain.conf
//root user//

#nano /etc/proxychanins.conf

//activate 'dynamic_chain' by bringing a '#' in front of that and deactivate 'Strict_chain'//

//add proxies, find the list of proxies in bottom//

socks5	127.0.0.1	9050

//default loopback (127.0.0.1) is used in order to make sure that the IP protocol setup correctly even though they do not have internet activity//

//search proxies from the internet, it is easy to get free proxies over internet and add below the proxy list//

socks5	ip_address	port

//save and exit//

Step02:	Go anonymous
//in terminal type it//

#service tor status			//to check tor status//
#service tor start			//to start tor service//
#service tor stop			//to stop tor service//
#proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com

//search for dnsleaktest, it will show the annonymus ip address which is added to proxy list//
